# Hi, I’m Mustafa 👋

Final-year Computer Science student focused on backend and applied AI systems.

I’m interested in building reliable, stateful services that operate under real-world constraints — handling concurrency, coordination, latency, and failure modes. My recent work explores how LLM-based systems and retrieval pipelines integrate into production backends in a controlled and measurable way ⚙️.

Recent projects include an autonomous IVR agent coordinating live audio streams and tool-constrained LLM execution, a cross-language TCP chat system, and an ECG-based arrhythmia detection pipeline with strict cross-validation 🤖.

I’m open to backend, distributed systems, and applied AI engineering opportunities 🚀.
