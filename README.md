# Hi, I’m Mustafa 👋

Final-year cs student focused on backend and applied AI systems.

I build reliable, stateful services that operate under real-world constraints — handling concurrency, coordination, latency, and failure modes. My work spans real-time voice agents that coordinate live audio streams and structured LLM tool execution, distributed messaging systems built over shared network protocols, and machine learning pipelines designed with strict validation and measurable performance ⚙️.

I’m open to backend, distributed systems, and applied AI engineering opportunities 🚀.
